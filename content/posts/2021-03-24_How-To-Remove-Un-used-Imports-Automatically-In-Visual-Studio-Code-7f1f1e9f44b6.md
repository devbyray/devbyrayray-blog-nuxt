If you‚Äôre working on a project that forces you to run all the linting before you can commit, you can sometimes feel frustrated. But most of the time, I forget to clean un-used imports in my TypoScript/JavaScript files.

Until just yet! I was so done with it ü•∫. I knew that there was an option or plugin for it. But though I had it installed.

Well, this can be fixed without any plugin üòÅ.

Open your settings in JSON.

And paste the following in it.

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {  
    "source.organizeImports": true  
}
```

Now, every time you press save, it will clean your un-used imports. This will save you time, energy, frustration, and building times for your React or Angular applications.

I hope this short post will save you a lot of time and hassle, as it did for me. ü§ó

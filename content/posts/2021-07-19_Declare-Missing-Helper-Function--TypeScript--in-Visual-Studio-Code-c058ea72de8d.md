As I was reading the “[Announcing TypeScript 4.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2/)” post on the TypeScript blog, I discovered a neat feature that is so simple but super valuable to me, so I love to share it here 😁

## How does it work?

When you call a function with parameters in a TypeScript file in Visual Studio Code, you get an ugly red line.

If you click the yellow balloon, you can generate a function declaration with typed parameters! [Alexander Trasyk](https://github.com/a-tarasyuk) builds this feature 💪.

Is there any feature you have discovered lately? Please share them 👍

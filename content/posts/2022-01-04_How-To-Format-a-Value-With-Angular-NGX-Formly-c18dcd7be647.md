Creating forms in Angular with NGX-Formly is super easy. But sometimes you want a little more, like formatting postal codes, phone numbers, or bank accounts. In this post, I will show you how you can do it.

I love to use [NGX-Formly](https://formly.dev/)! They make writing small, big, and even complex forms easier. But lately, I have wanted to change the format of input values after the user has filled them in. Because there is a certain way, the backend API expects them.

## NGX-Formly Formatters

For example, we want to create a postal code field and a field for initials. In these fields, we want to apply specific formatting on the value. In this case, it will be visual formatting, nothing very complex.

The logic behind the `formatInitials()` method looks like this.

So every field that needs a formatter needs a property `parser.`

```ts
{
  parsers: [(value: string) => value?.toUpperCase()],
}
```

The parser needs to be an array of functions. Every function has a parameter that holds the value. Since the parsers need an Array, you can apply multiple formatters on every field.

The function needs to return a new value. So it can be updated in the input field.

Ensure that the field config also has the property `expressionProperties` in which the model is updated; otherwise, it will not work.

```ts
expressionProperties: {
   'model.postal': 'model.postal',
},
```

## Example

I‚Äôve created an example project for this tutorial via [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vibhz9?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts), which you can use to experiment with the parsers.

<stackblitz id="angular-vibhz9" filename="src/app/app.component.ts" height="700"></stackblitz>

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this tutorial helps you to format your values easier with NGX-Formly. And if you didn‚Äôt use NGX-Formly, I hope this will let you build forms even faster!

Good luck and have fun.

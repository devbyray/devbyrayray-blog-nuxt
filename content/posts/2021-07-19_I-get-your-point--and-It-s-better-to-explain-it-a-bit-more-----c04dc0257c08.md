I get your point, and It's better to explain it a bit more. ðŸ˜‰

There are professional developers with a lot of different strengths and weaknesses. One is better in database management, and the other is better with creating user-friendly UI's.

One developer is visually strong, and the other is very strong with algorithms.

For the professional frontend developer, it can be beneficial to use a low code platform to get a faster visual result. We don't have to worry about what kind of build system is used or is the CSS and JavaScript optimized.

Most low-code platforms automate many tasks for you, which you have to do yourself when you have a code first process. This way, we can focus more on the user experience, which is essential for every application.

For a professional backend developer, it can be beneficial too. Some low-code platforms will generate optimized backend models and code for you, which you can deploy to your favorite hosting provider.

Others have integrations with Azure or AWS, for example. This will make the life of a backend developer a lot easier. Even some platforms offer functionality for scaling up and down traffic.

When the usage of low-code platforms benefits professional developers, it will also help companies. Because hiring a developer can be very expensive for smaller companies.

Smaller organizations can build the first version with no-code. When that application needs more functionalities, they have to hire fewer professional developers to support their office people to extend functionality.

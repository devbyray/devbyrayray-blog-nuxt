I’m Ray, a Frontend Developer since 2009 living in the Netherlands. I write about Frontend Development,
JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, CSS, VueJS and a lot more related topics.

I love to teach, educate and write about my work and interests to help others as well ass creating a
content library for myself to refer to every time I want.


Hi, I’m Ray, a developer from the Netherlands. I started writing blogs at the very beginning of my developer career in 2012. I love to write because it helps me to learn new things, it’s an outlet for my creativity, and it helps others learn new things.

I love helping; that’s why I kept writing all those years.

Most of the time, I’m writing developer tutorials. But more and more, the topics become wider. I want to share my optimistic mindset in everything I publish.

Since late 2016 I’m writing on Medium. I’ve written countless stories to help and inspire others.

I believe in achieving success through growth. But there is no growth without failure. Embrace failure, and you’re on your way to success!

JavaScript is my favorite language to build excellent user interactions, so I’ve written most of my stories about that.

I hope you love my writing ❤️. When you do, you can subscribe via email. Every time I post a new story, you will be the first to hear from me!

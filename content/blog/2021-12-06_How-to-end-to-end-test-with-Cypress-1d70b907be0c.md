What is end-to-end testing? We have two ends in a Web application: the front-end and the back-end. With unit-testing, we test the code for the front-end or the back-end. We don‚Äôt test how the application behaves in the browser or how both ends work together.

Writing unit tests is good, in my opinion!

But testing how the front-end and back-end work together is equally important.

We test if the front-end works well with the back-end with end-to-end testing. So automatically filling forms, clicking buttons, navigate through the pages should be tested by end-to-end tests.

Running the end-to-end tests will validate if your front-end is handling the data correctly received from the back-end.

### What is¬†Cypress?

There are a lot of end-to-end testing toolkits, but one of the most popular and fastest toolkits is [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

Cypress offers a way of writing end-to-end tests with JavaScript and the test runner. Next to that, they offer a way to save screenshots and video‚Äôs when a test fails. What most organizations love, it‚Äôs open-source, and that is great.

### How do we use Cypress with end-to-end testing?

There is a [great tutorial](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test#Write-your-first-test) in the Cypress documentation to get you started on writing end-to-end tests.

#### The configuration

At the root of the project, there is a `cypress.json` where you can change some default configurations. In our project, it looks like this:

```
{    "testFiles": "**/*.e2e.test.js",    "chromeWebSecurity": false}
```

In the `testFiles` property, we tell Cypress to look for files that include `e2e.test.js` in the name. You can configure Cypress with TypeScript, but in this case, I think there is no added value to using it. It requires an additional transpilation step that takes longer.

#### Where to store the test¬†files?

With unit-testing, it‚Äôs very common to store the tests in the component folders. In this case, Cypress takes the `cypress/integration` folder as the root to look for the files. So we have a structure based on the application itself, in which we store the end-to-end testing files.

### Minimal requirements of an end-to-end test

Every test has at least a `describe()` function within that at least one `it()` function. This works similarly to writing unit tests.

This example looks like a unit test. So we need to make use of the Cypress Library. You can use that by using `cy` like the example below in which we visit `[https://example.cypress.io](https://example.cypress.io.)`[.](https://example.cypress.io.)

You can see the real browser performing this action by running `npm run e2e:open`.

Our scripts in the `package.json` look like this.

Cypress will start its application, and there you can select the end-to-end test you want to run. By default, it will open the Chrome browser, but there is also an option to run it in Firefox and Edge.

Cypress offers a complete library, and you can check the [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/table-of-contents) on what they all include.

### What should you test in an end-to-end test?

We will mainly test things that appear or change in the browser with end-to-end tests. Like a simple scenario: We visit page x and check if the `h1` contains the text "This is an awesome title".

In this example, every method you call from the `cy` library is part of testing. Like `cy.visit()` will perform the action, but if there is no valid page on that URL, it will fail your test. So with every action you perform, you commit an assertion.

> In Cypress, there are two different types of assertions. First ‚ÄúImplicit Subjects‚Äù, in this case you use `should()` or `and()`. Second, "Explicit Subjects", in this case, you use `expect`. Read more on this in the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Writing-Assertions).

When calling `cy.get('h1')` it will search for the `<h1>` tag. When it finds that element, your test will continue. It will fail the test if it doesn't find the element in a few milliseconds. After the `get` method, you can chain a lot of other methods, like:

*   `.contains()` expects the element with content to eventually exist in the DOM.
*   `.find()` also expects the element to exist in the DOM eventually.
*   `.type()` expects the element to eventually be in a typeable state.
*   `.click()` expects the element to eventually be in an actionable state.¬†`.its()` expects to eventually find a property on the current subject.

So what should we test in end-to-end tests?

1.  If an element has a certain class `cy.get('element.selector').should('have.class', 'ng-valid');` or doesn't have a certain class `cy.get('element.selector').should('not.have.class', 'ng-valid');`.
2.  If a list has 3 child elements `cy.get('ul > li').should('have.length', 3);`.
3.  Check if an input field or textarea has a certain value `cy.get('input[name="firstName"]').type('Santa Claus').should('have.value', 'Santa Claus');`.

> Check [this list of examples](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions#Adding-New-Assertions) what you can use in the `should` method.

**Extra example:**

Add the context of a parent element to perform assertions, which comes in handy with forms.

> Check for more examples of the `_within()_` method in the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/within#Examples).

### Re-usable functionality

In the case of re-useable actions that you perform over-and-over-again, you can write simple functions that you can put in a lib folder. But Cypress offers a more friendly way of doing this. These are called ‚Äúcustom commands‚Äù; you can find a lot of examples [in the documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Log-in-command-using-UI).

But one of the best examples is writing the command for the login. You need to add that code in the `cypress/support/commands.js` file.

### Conclusion

Now it‚Äôs up to you to write great end-to-end tests with Cypress! Perfect tests don‚Äôt exist, but if you optimize them a bit every time, they will become your source of truth. The end-to-end tests are great for developers to run after building a new feature or changing an existing one because it‚Äôs impossible to keep all the testing scenarios in your brain.

Good luck, and have fun with writing valuable end-to-end tests.

Great question! It took me a bit of thought. Some people will get sleeping within 10 min others will stay in bed for an hour before they fall asleep ðŸ˜…  
  
I think that itâ€™s important that you do it when your ready to go to bed or go to sleep. The process in our subconscious mind is the most important part in my opinion.  
  
So if thatâ€™s for you 30 min, and for others 10 min doesnâ€™t really matter I think.  
  
Hope this helps you and make it more clear ðŸ˜Š

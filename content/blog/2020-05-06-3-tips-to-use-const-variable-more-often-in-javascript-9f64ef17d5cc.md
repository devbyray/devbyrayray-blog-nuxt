We should use the `const` variable more often in JavaScript. I want to share my 3 tips on when you can use `const` instead of using `let` or `var`.

## 1\. Const Variables Usage

A lot of times we found ourselves storing information in a variable, no `var` is not a good fit anymore. (find out why in [another post](https://itnext.io/what-is-the-scope-in-javascript-a2add52bf9d8).)

From my experience a lot of times the information doesnâ€™t need to change, so we can use the `const` variable.

Only use `let` if it needs to change, otherwise use the `const` variable by default.

But Ray, what about `object` and `array` they need to be changed a lot of times.

> _Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the_ [_let_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) _keyword. The value of a constant canâ€™t be changed through reassignment, and it canâ€™t be redeclared. Source:_ [_MDN Web Docs_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)

Thatâ€™s true! But we can store them in a `const` and still add and remove information because this wonâ€™t change the data type. So pick a `const` variable to store the `object` or `array`.

## 2\. Forâ€¦of and forâ€¦in loops: use const variables

We all know these ugly for-loops in JavaScript or any other languages. But since ES2015 there are 2 for-loops which are much easier to write and read.

The forâ€¦of and forâ€¦in loops are so simple! Days are over that you have to create a variable that has to add a number every iteration.

And the nice thing is, you can use `const` variables in them, which you canâ€™t do with the normal for-loop.

### Forâ€¦of

The forâ€¦of loop is for looping over iterable objects. You can use it with String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables.

```
const arr = ['Angular', 'React', 'VueJS', 'Svelte', '', 'React']
```

```
for(const item of arr) {    console.log(item)}
```

In comparison to the for-loop where the variable is being updated every iteration. The forâ€¦of loop the `const`variable is being created with every iteration.

### Forâ€¦in

The forâ€¦in loop is for looping over the properties of an Object.

```
const object = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
```

```
for (const property in object) {  console.log(`${property}: ${object[property]}`);}
```

Like the forâ€¦of loop, the `const` variable is being created every iteration. Donâ€™t use a `let` or `var` here.

## 3\. Store Elements in Const variables

If you need to access the DOM by using `querySelector` for example, I see a lot of times that people use `var` or `let`.

But if you only want to access the element, itâ€™s better to store it in a `const` variable.

```
const wrapper = document.querySelector('.wrapper')
```

Even if you are gonna change the element, `const` is still a good choice. Because the element is an `Object` so it can change when needed.

## The Problem With¬†Objects

You‚Äôre deep into your code, and suddenly you get an error: ‚ÄúCannot read property _x_ of undefined.‚Äù _Awww, man_.

Most of the time, this means debugging‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääattacking my code with `debugger` here, `console.log()` there. Most of the time, I get it fixed fast. But there are those days that it takes me hours.

## Example Problem

We have an object called `car`.

.

The car object has a set of key-value pairs. We get this information from our API. Normally, you‚Äôd get an `events` property inside the object that includes the property `last_updated‚Ää`‚Äî‚Äästating the last time this information has been changed.

When running this code, we get an error.

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'last_updated' of undefined at <anonymous>:1:14
```

To prevent the error, we have to check if the property `events` is in the object or not.

This way, we don‚Äôt have an error if the `event` property is not in our object. But I find this code to be not that readable.

## The Map¬†Solution

When we turn our object into a `Map()`, we get all the clear methods from the map.

You can turn your object into a map with the `Object.entries()` method and give it your object as a parameter.

This would be the output of the map.

A `Map()` has a range of handy methods we can use to make our code more readable, predictable, and with fewer chances for getting errors.

*   `set('key', 'value')` store a key-value pair
*   `get('key')` returns the value of a key if available
*   `has('key')` returns `true` or `false` depending on if the key exists
*   `delete('key')` deletes a key-value pair from the map
*   `clear()` removes all the key-value pairs from the map
*   `size()` returns the amount of key-value pairs from the map

So if we want to have the information `last_updated` from the `events` the property, we use the¬†`.has('prop')` method. This method returns a boolean based on the existence of the property.

In your console, you‚Äôll see the console logged `‚Äònot available‚Äô` without any errors.

> As already a few other helpful developers showed in the comments. The Map isn‚Äôt maybe the best solution for every problem for making your Objects more predictable.

> It turns out that the [Reflect API](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-reflection-in-depth), [Optional chaining](https://v8.dev/features/optional-chaining) or even better, [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) helps to write JavaScript that is more predictable.

> Still, I think it could be an interesting solution üòâ

## Conclusion

I think using `Map()` can make your code more readable, predictable, and less sensitive to errors. With the normal `Object`, your code will give errors when a certain property is missing. This will lead to bad user experience, so let's prevent this.

If you want to check out more details about `Map()`, please check out the [detailed page of MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).

I hope you learned something new with this piece. Happy coding!

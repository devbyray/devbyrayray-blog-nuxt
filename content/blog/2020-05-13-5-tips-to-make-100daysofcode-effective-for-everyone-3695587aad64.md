100daysofcode is not a hype, it’s a movement! A positive movement by people that what into development and programming.

A lot of them want to leave their jobs, some don’t and that is fine. The want to build applications and websites through their written code.

I’ve watched this movement since 2017, and I love to help these people! That’s why I write on Medium and started a community on discord.

But in this post, I want to give 5 tips for those who want to make a success of their 100daysofcode journey. Sit back, relax, and grab some pen and paper (or your favorite notes app) to take notes of your favorite ones.

> 100daysofcode is used by aspiring developers. But it can also be effective for experienced developers as well 👍

## 1\. Define your goals

Before you begin on your 100daysofcode journey you must define your goals.

Those goals will guide you on which road you take.

Goals can be:

1.  Get a job as a developer
2.  Build a website
3.  Build a native app
4.  Start with DIY projects at home (Raspberry Pi)

But whatever your goals are, it is your goal! Not the goal of someone else!

So write down your goals, to stay on the road towards your goal. And if you take some side steps, it is not a problem, but it helps you remind your goals.

Make your goal very specific, this will help! Also, don’t make it too big. Because if you reached your goal, you can define a new goal 😊

## 2\. How To Get Started

If you have defined your goal, you can define a plan of action. Slit your goals into simple and small steps.

Dive into your goal what it takes to reach your goal. This helps to have a structured plan.

Don’t be afraid to miss a step! Don’t feel guilty! Acknowledge you have missed a step and go back on track!

Getting into programming can be very overwhelming! There are a lot of things you will discover along the way! It’s not possible to know everything upfront!

## 3\. Build a habit of coding

With the 100daysofcode you will develop a habit of coding. But I’ve seen a lot of people following the free courses by FreeCodeCamp, which can be helpful!

But after that, they never build a thing for themselves. The tutorials can be helpful. But if you only build things with tutorials you won’t learn as much as building things yourself.

With tutorials, you gain technical knowledge but you will have less chance to have bugs or errors. But those bugs and errors will force you to dive deeper into the technical things. It will force you to Google and find solutions that work or won’t work.

To build a habit with coding is good! Building a habit with coding where you build things on your own is even better!

## 4\. Keep it simple

Keep things simple! With that I mean don’t make your goals big and broad. But make it simple and small. Via this way, you can track your work better.

Next to that, make keep your code simple too!

Because complex code doesn’t make you a better developer. Making complex solutions look easy and readable will make you better as a developer.

To solve complex problems, you don’t need complex code. It’s a skill to write simple code to solve them.

## 5\. Don’t be afraid to miss a day

In your journey, don’t be afraid to miss a day. Don’t feel guilty about it! It’s your journey right, you have nobody you owe it too.

If you miss a day, accept it, admit it, and do better the next day. Because sometimes you need a day off. Nobody can do coding the whole day long and don’t feel tired after a few days.

Enjoy that missed day! Make it count for YOU!

I would format my dates with the [Intl.DateTimeFormat()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) or I would use [Date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) because it's modular. But I would never use Moment.js anymore because of it's bulky size in bundles ðŸ˜‰

Sass functions like `lighten()`, `darken()`, `complement()`, `invert()` are pretty useful. I was wondering if there was something for styled-components. Well, I found the great library [Polished.js](https://polished.js.org/).

The nice thing about this library is that it doesnâ€™t matter if you use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), [emotion](https://emotion.sh/), [jss](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.6.0), [aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite), [radium](https://formidable.com/open-source/radium/), or just inline styling in JavaScript. It works with all of them!

It is a utility library, so you only import what you need to save some bytes for the user. Do you need typings for TypeScript? They got you covered!

So letâ€™s dive into how to use Polished.js.

### Installation

Running the all-familiar command is enough for the installation.

npm install --save polished  
\# or if you're using yarn  
yarn add polished

### Importing

Import the utility function you need in the JavaScript, TypeScript, or React component file.

import { cssVar, darken } from 'polished'

My favorite functions are `lighten()`, `darken()`, `complement()` and `linearGradient()` but they have loads more [functions in their documentation](https://polished.js.org/docs/).

### Usage

To demonstrate how you can use Polished.js with styled-components, we will create a component for a `<input>` field. I'm gonna use the CSS variable to make it darker for the background of my `<input>` field.

My CSS variables are defined in the `global.css` file in the public folder. I'm currently using this in a Next.js project.

The `cssVar()` function can pull the variables from the root and turn them to a darker color.

The output color becomes `#eee`. So I don't have to decide that for myself.

### Better usage

But I think it would be even better to define this as its own color in the root component from my React/Next application. I have a `<Layout>` component as my root component, so it's best to define those CSS variables in there.

Since I want my colors to be available in my JavaScript, Iâ€™ve created a function with all the colors in it. Iâ€™ve added this to a separate file to make it easier to re-use in the future. Now I can assign this to a const variable `root` to make it available in a component.

Now we can use the `<GlobalStyle />` component in the `<Layout />` component. Now all the CSS variables are available across the application.

So in my `<Input />` component, I can use my CSS variables like any other component.

### Conclusion

I hope you learned something new from this post. If you use other utilities for your CSS-in-JS, please share them. I love to hear them!

_Happy Coding_ ðŸš€

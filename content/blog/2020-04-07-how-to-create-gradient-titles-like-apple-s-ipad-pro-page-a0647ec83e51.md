**I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve seen the new iPad Proâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI think itâ€™s awesome! But I want to talk about Apple product pages which, just like the new iPad Pro, Iâ€™m a big fan of. I noticed that they have some cool titles with a gradient backgroundâ€¦**

The first thing I did was try to select the text. In the early days, images were created with JavaScript via the `<canvas>` tag so the text would not be selectable. But surprisingly enough I could select the text!

I inspected how Apple made the gradient background. In this article, Iâ€™m going to teach you to do it too.

## Background-clip: text

All you need to do is put a background image or gradient on the tag and a few other properties:

```
h1 {    background-clip: text;  -webkit-background-clip: text;  color: transparent;    background-size: cover;    background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557682224-5b8590cd9ec5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=800&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjF9');}
```

We have to add a prefix, `-webkit-background-clip`, for Safari, or it won't work. For Chrome and Firefox, it will work perfectly fine.

## Background Gradient

To make it more lightweight we can use a CSS background gradient:

```
h1 {    background-clip: text;  -webkit-background-clip: text;  color: transparent;    background-size: cover;    background: linear-gradient(147deg, rgba(249,15,216,1) 0%, rgba(245,67,119,1) 26%, rgba(252,28,28,1) 50%, rgba(255,195,13,1) 75%, rgba(114,251,89,1) 100%);}
```

There are a few generators that can help you make these gradients.

If you need inspiration for awesome gradients, [uiGradient.com](https://uigradients.com/#MegaTron) is a great resource.

### CSS Gradient

[CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) lets you create complex CSS background gradients with a simple editor. When youâ€™re done you can copy the CSS and paste it into your code.

## Example

Iâ€™ve created a demo with the CSS background-clip. If you need gradient images, check Unsplash for free images.

I want to include your examples here too! If you make something cool with the `background-clip: text;`, add the link in the comment so I can include them to inspire others.

## Browser Support

According to [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.comhttps//caniuse.com/#feat=background-img-opts), itâ€™s supported in all major browsers, even since IE9.

Safari does not support `-webkit-background-clip: text;` for `<button>` elements. But you can put `<span>`inside `<button>` to get the same result. (Source: [canisue.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=background-img-opts)).

_Happy coding! ðŸš€_

## Conclusion

I have discovered that the browser programmers work hard to support all kinds of new CSS features. I hope this will gave you some new possibilities for your CSS toolbox.

Iâ€™m looking forwards to seeing all the cool things you build with it!

## 1\. Don’t Be Afraid to Fail

This is the all-time favorite that I will share with everyone! Don’t be afraid to fail. If you are afraid to fail, you will never try new things. You will never learn new things.

> If you are afraid to fail, you will never try new things.

Experienced developers failed a lot more than they succeeded! That’s what made them grow. They learned things a certain way and didn’t choose another way.

If you accept that failure is part of development or part of life then you will accept that not everything will go as you planned. If you accept failure, you also embrace learning. Because failure can be turned into a lesson.

Well, as a developer, you should be a flexible learner, you should try new stuff to train your brain or build expertise. Just admit you failed, check what you could learn from that failure and embrace it as a lesson for the next time!

## 2\. Be a Flexible Learner

As a developer, it is very handy to be flexible. The main reason for that is that it is an illusion to think you can learn everything! In the world of a developer, there is so much different stuff to think of, it won’t fit in your brain!

Techniques, libraries, and frameworks come and go. So, you will often need to change or adjust.

## 3\. Don’t Be Afraid to Ask for Help

Sometimes, it will happen that you are completely stuck with a bug or problem. Keep in mind to ask someone you know or if you don’t know anyone, please use Stack Overflow or even better, Quora (that is my personal opinion).

There are very friendly developers who want to help you and explain what the problem is. So, get over the fear and just ask for help.

Of course, I would love to help you out!

## Conclusion

The tips in this post are gained by myself the hard way. Nobody told me this, but I learned this by failing and learning.

If you have any questions or need advice, please ask in the comments and I will do my best to help you as good as I can.

Do you have any personal tips to share for developers who are just starting? Please share them in the comments.

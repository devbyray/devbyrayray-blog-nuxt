Thanks for your comment Robert. I made some adjustments in the post to clarify why I use the BehaviourSubject.

I create a [StackBlitz example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-content-dictionary-service?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts), to show why the BehaviourSubject is an important part of theÂ service.

If you just want to have a simpler version you could, indeed just use a variable ðŸ˜‰

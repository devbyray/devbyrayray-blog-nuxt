These years the frontend development tools are popping up like mushrooms from the ground! One is better or suits your workflow better than the other.

Recently I discovered [Vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/), build by [Evan You](https://medium.com/u/4f198f5f1f12), the starter of the framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

### What is¬†Vite.js?

It‚Äôs blazingly fast, supports TypeScript out of the box, and uses ESM modules. Vite.js is a perfect tool for building your Vue, React, and Vanilla JavaScript projects.

The simplicity of setting up Vite.js is why I choose this tool for my prototyping projects in TypeScript & React. But also, when building a JavaScript Library, Vite is a perfect choice.

_Happy Coding! üöÄ_

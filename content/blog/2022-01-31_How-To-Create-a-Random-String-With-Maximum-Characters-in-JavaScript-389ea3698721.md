You can use a library for generating random data in JavaScript, but I think it‚Äôs even cooler to do it yourself. If you want to spice up your JavaScript skills, these functions are the best to practice.

So in this post, I would like to explain how you can generate random strings with a maximum amount of characters. This post is a follow-up to my previous post [How To Create a Random String with JavaScript](https://hasnode.byrayray.dev/how-to-create-a-random-string-with-javascript).

If you haven‚Äôt checked my previous post, I highly recommend checking it out. In this, we will continue with that last function from that post.

```
function randomString() {    return [...Array(5)].map((value) => (Math.random() * 1000000).toString(36).replace('.', '')).join('');}
```

This function now generates a random string with a variable length.

The return value is always different.

```
randomString();'63lklfirmmc2baknxlzou171jyq7q7wnd8ag53r6kv95buvp1qme8ou'randomString();'j9qfsxifdugz5bgfmqfwg3c2jefsidxikhl2c4qjwti6i0zm5y5x5'
```

But right now, we want to make sure that it has a certain length so we have more control over the data we generate.

We only have to make sure that the Array it‚Äôs starting with has the length.

### Minimal length

To make sure we have at least the number of characters we are given in the function parameter, we are making the Array a bit longer.

```
[...Array(length + 10)]
```

### Fixed length

But to prevent that will be longer, we are taking a substring, so we are returning the exact amount of characters by using `substring`.

```
[...Array(length + 10)].map((value) => (Math.random() * 1000000).toString(36).replace('.', '')).join('').substring(0, length);
```

This will be our result if we turn all of this into a function.

```
function randomString(length = 50) {    return [...Array(length + 10)].map((value) => (Math.random() * 1000000).toString(36).replace('.', '')).join('').substring(0, length);};
```

I recommend playing around with this function and using it for something practical.

### Thanks!

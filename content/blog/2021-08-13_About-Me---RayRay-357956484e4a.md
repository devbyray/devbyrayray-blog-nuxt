Hi, I’m Ray, a developer from the Netherlands. I started writing blogs at the very beginning of my developer career in 2012. I love to write because it helps me to learn new things, it’s an outlet for my creativity, and it helps others learn new things.

I love helping; that’s why I kept writing all those years.

Most of the time, I’m writing developer tutorials. But more and more, the topics become wider. I want to share my optimistic mindset in everything I publish.

Since late 2015 I’m writing on Medium. I’ve written countless stories to help and inspire others.

I believe in achieving success through growth. But there is no growth without failure. Embrace failure, and you’re on your way to success!

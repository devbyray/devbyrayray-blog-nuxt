Just like regular CSS, you write your Media Queries in your CSS file. In Styled Components, you can include them as well.

But if you want to make it smart, you set all the sizes in an Object and create a function to call them from your styled-components in React.

Create a file `breakpoints.js`.

Import the file in the component where you defined your styled-components, and you can easily use your media queries without remembering your exact sizes.

I believe in making it yourself as simple as possible, so hopefully, this solution will help you further.

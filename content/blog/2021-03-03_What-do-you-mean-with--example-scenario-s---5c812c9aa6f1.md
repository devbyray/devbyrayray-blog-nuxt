What do you mean with "example scenario's"? Do you mean describing a situation? Or come up with a story?

Most of my posts are based on things I learned or challenges I had. Like this recent one [https://javascript.plainenglish.io/cant-access-camera-or-microphone-in-webrtc-apps-solve-using-navigator-mediadevices-web-api-c0ffe5cbd32c](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/cant-access-camera-or-microphone-in-webrtc-apps-solve-using-navigator-mediadevices-web-api-c0ffe5cbd32c) I had some issues with getting my camera to work with WebRTC, but finally I figured out how to solve the problem.

A great way for writing technical stories is how you fixed problems ðŸ˜‰

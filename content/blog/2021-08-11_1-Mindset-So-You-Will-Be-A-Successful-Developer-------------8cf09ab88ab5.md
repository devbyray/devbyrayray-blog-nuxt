#### DEVELOPER MINDSET

So many developers are focussing on success, but what is success? Why do they all want to become 10x developers? Is it something everyone can achieve? Or is it only for the best of the best?

### What Is¬†Success?

Everyone has a different definition of success. Mine can be completely different than yours, and that is the beauty of it!

It doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt make mistakes! It means that you take essential lessons out of your failures and use them to your advantage.

Winston Churchill once said:

> _Success is not final, Failure is not Fatal. It is the courage to continue that¬†counts!_

I believe this is the right attitude to become a successful developer. Successful developers still make mistakes; we are all humans, after all, right üòâ. As long as we turn our failures into successes, we will be successful.

A junior developer can be as successful as a senior developer. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long you are doing your job as a developer. It matters that you don‚Äôt let failure stop you.

For me, success can be that other developers easily understand the code I wrote, but the code is still performant. For you, success can be, working on an application with Angular and hosting it on AWS.

Success is for everyone different.

### How To Achieve Success as a Developer?

First of all, don‚Äôt be afraid to make mistakes!

Because being successful as a developer doesn‚Äôt stop at the point when you make mistakes, no, do everything with the best intention and best of your knowledge.

For example, suppose you are designing the architecture for a high-performance application. In that case, you will do your research, think about the failures you made in the past and apply those lessons to create good architecture.

At some point, you are happy with the architecture you have designed.

I believe you won‚Äôt achieve success all by yourself. I think you achieve it with the help of others. So let others review your work. This is a way to learn from the mistakes of others; this is not to define you as not good enough.

Since you can‚Äôt achieve success by doing everything perfectly, you have to learn from your own and others‚Äô mistakes.

### What Is A Successful Developer?

A successful developer is not defined by many years of experience, nor a junior, medior, senior, or lead developer. It‚Äôs determined by how you can turn failures into lessons and apply them in your daily work.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you dream in code or searching the web every day for code. As long as you progress and learn something new every day, you will be a successful developer.

### How To Stay Succesful As Developer

It‚Äôs all in the mindset.

Does happens to the most and best of us. Sometimes there will be days when you have no motivation or energy to code. Those are the moments when you need to take a break and look at your work from a broader perspective.

Those are the moments where you can look back on what you already learned last weeks or months. Since our work takes so much energy from our brains, it‚Äôs good to write it down for yourself.

Don‚Äôt forget the things that made you secretly proud! Write them down! They are valuable for you! They help you stay successful.

### Conclusion

Others do not define a successful developer! Okay, sometimes it feels great that others define us as successful. But the most important person on this earth is yourself.

As long as you look to yourself as a successful developer, you are not afraid to make mistakes and turn those mistakes into valuable lessons.

That is the point where you are a successful developer!

_Happy coding üöÄ_

I want to create a habit for myself to improve my writing and writing more often to develop that habit. I’m calling this “The Undefined Dev” because it’s gonna be about what I do, working on, like and a lot more developer-related things.

It’s been a while I’ve sent a newsletter, but I was not sitting still of course. I’ve written a lot of posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@devbyrayray?utm_source=devbyrayray&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=build-darkmode-with-typescript-and-css-variables) which I enjoyed doing.

Lately, I’ve created a [video](https://coderdojo.nl/online-les/html-css/les-1?utm_source=devbyrayray&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=build-darkmode-with-typescript-and-css-variables) for my little friends at the Dutch organization [Coder Dojo Nederland](https://coderdojo.nl/) to support kids with learning to build their website with HTML & CSS. (_Yes, it’s in dutch_)

Currently, I’m working on a new content idea, so I made a little demo for it. It’s to build a dark mode for your website with TypeScript and the cool CSS variables.

It’s so easy! Everyone can do it with ease.

Here is the draft I’m working on at [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/css-variables-darkmode-w-typescript-s6e2k?utm_source=devbyrayray&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=build-darkmode-with-typescript-and-css-variables), let me know what you think of it.

I will create a full tutorial on this, so I hope you are patient with that.

If you have any content suggestions to write, please let me know.

I hope you are safe and healthy!

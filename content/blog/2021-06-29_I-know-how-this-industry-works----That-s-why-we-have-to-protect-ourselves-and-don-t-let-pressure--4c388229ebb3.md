I know how this industry works ðŸ˜… Thatâ€™s why we have to protect ourselves and donâ€™t let pressure decides what we do. But decides ourselves what we do.

For example, I know Frontend Devs who donâ€™t do JavaScript, but they master CSS and stick with that. I think, that if a dev decides to do it his/her own way, itâ€™s a very powerful personðŸ˜‰

But yes this industry doesnâ€™t make it very easy to do it our own way ðŸ˜…

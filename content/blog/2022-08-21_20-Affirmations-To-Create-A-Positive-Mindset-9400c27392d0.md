#### LAW OF ATTRACTION

Affirmations for Self-love and Self-believe + FREEBIES

![](/Users/devbyrayray/Downloads/medium-export-a7b31d8cfbafc479a349e86525a0598d57555fb548cdfad5aa20f48d7b4db09d/posts/md_1664876347726/img/0__ZH0RQJMJmEBXQNmV.jpg)

Affirmations are used to change our thoughts and behaviors. When we repeat positive statements repeatedly, they become engrained in our subconscious minds. These statements then influence how we think, act, and feel. In this story, I go over some affirmations that have helped me change my mindset.

My favorite technique is listening to affirmations at night while falling asleep. If you do this, listen to them before bed rather than right before going to sleep. Why? Because just before going to sleep, your mind is still awake and thinking about anything and everything. Listening to affirmations before you fall asleep puts you in a state where your conscious and subconscious minds are relaxed and ready to receive and process information.

Since I‚Äôm working with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) (also [TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript), React, GraphQL, [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) & [Storyblok CMS](https://www.storyblok.com/)) I was wondering, is it possible to use CSS variable‚Äôs in Styled Components.

As you can see in the example above, it is possible and super simple, just like in normal CSS. So make sure that you CSS variable are created in a parent component. It can also be created on a page/layout level if you like.

So I hope this helps you further with building a cool Next.js or React application with Styled-components.

_Happy coding üöÄ_

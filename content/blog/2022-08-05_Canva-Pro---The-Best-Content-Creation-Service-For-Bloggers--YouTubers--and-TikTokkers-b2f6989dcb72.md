Since I started writing blogs, making videos, and composing tweets, I have used all kinds of tools to make lovely creative images. Back in the day, I used Photoshop most of the time.

A few years back, I was searching for something simpler, a way to make these creative images and videos for my blogs on my smartphone or tablet.

My smartphone is becoming more and more important for creativity and writing my ideas for content. So I found a companion in Canva.

### Why I Switched From Photoshop to Canva?

The possibilities for Photoshop are endless. Well, you have to spend so much time getting comfortable with it. You can create stunning images and artwork with it. But I think it’s too complex to make simple creative images for social media, blogs, or newsletters. Yes, you can use it on different devices, but it’s not that easy.

Canva, on the other hand, is multi-platform by nature. Use it on every browser, mobile device, and touch device. Wherever you want!

Creating an image for social media or video intro for Youtube is as easy as picking a great template, changing colors for your branch, change your logo and content. And there you have your result.

Want to resize it? It’s a piece of cake changing the width and height. It doesn’t matter if you're creating an image or video.

What made me change?

*   Easy interface
*   Social media image, video, and presentation in no-time
*   I choose on which device I start or continue
*   Never lose files; everything is saved in the cloud! 👍

### My favorite features of Canva Pro

[Canva](https://partner.canva.com/c/2339544/811170/10068) has loads of features, but I love to show you my favorite 5.

**Feature 1: Templates**

![](/Users/devbyrayray/Downloads/medium-export-a7b31d8cfbafc479a349e86525a0598d57555fb548cdfad5aa20f48d7b4db09d/posts/md_1664876347726/img/1__qYQqiOmE4OW2la2W3qBUxw.png)

The best feature of [Canva](https://partner.canva.com/c/2339544/811170/10068) is the templates! They have loads of templates in every category you might need. Presentations, Instagram Posts or Stories, TikTok, Youtube Thumbnails, and Facebook Cover photos are examples they have.

Some creative people even sell their [Canva Templates via Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/canva_templates).

#### Feature 2: Resizing

Resizing is a feature of the Canva Pro tier. (_You can try Canva Pro 30 days for free_) You can set any dimension you like. But you can also choose from the predefined sizes for a Facebook Post or an Instagram Story.

> In the free tier, you can set the size beforehand. But if you like to have a different size later on, just open a new Canva project and copy all your objects and paste them into the new project _😅_.

#### Feature 3: Animations

Animations are great for videos and presentations. You can find this feature in the free tier as well.

There are page animations where you can set the animation type for the whole page or select every object in your design and apply a different animation.

#### Feature 4: Brand kit

Every brand has its colors and fonts. Well, Canva makes it super easy to make a set of brand colors, brand logos, and fonts.

Whenever you select an object where you can change the color or font, it’s easily selectable. Next to that, they also give options of colors already in photos that are included in your design.

#### Feature 5: Exporting

After you finish your design, you want to download it to your computer or smartphone. Click the share button and press download to see all your options. Most options are for the free tier, some are only in the Pro tier.

### Pricing of Canva

For months I’ve used the free tier of [Canva](https://partner.canva.com/c/2339544/811170/10068). In my opinion, there are not a lot of restrictions when using the free tier. You can’t use Premium photos, resizing afterward isn’t possible, some export limitations. But there are still a ton of things you can do 👍

For a Pro account, you pay 109,99 euros a year per person. If you want to use it as a team, you pay 139,99 euros a year per 5 persons.

If you prefer a monthly payment instead of a yearly. It will be a bit more expensive. 11,99 euros per month for the Pro tier or 13,99 euros a month for the Pro Teams tier.

But if you compare this pricing against the Creative Cloud by Adobe, [Canva](https://partner.canva.com/c/2339544/811170/10068) is way cheaper. It’s just a matter of what you need.

### Canva Pro is the best solution for…

Maybe [Canva](https://partner.canva.com/c/2339544/811170/10068) is not for every content creator, but I think it’s awesome for a great variety of content creators like:

*   Creative people
*   YouTubers
*   TikTokkers
*   Social Media managers
*   Influencers
*   Developers
*   Marketing managers
*   And a lot more.

Thanks for your question!

I don't know if it is possible. But Storybook supports TypeScript, it sounds logical that they support something like ClojureScript as well.

But I'm not familiair with ClojureScript to be honest. I found this blogpost with a link to Github, maybe [this blog is usefull for you](https://davidvujic.blogspot.com/2021/08/component-driven-clojurescript-with-storybook.html) there is a video on [Youtube as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beMFh99EE7w)

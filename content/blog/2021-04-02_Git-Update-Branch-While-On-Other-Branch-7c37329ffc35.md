I have those moments quite frequently, I need to update my `develop` branch, but I don't want to switch to it in git.

Well, I discovered a way to fetch another branch you‚Äôre working in, but you don‚Äôt need to switch.

git fetch origin develop:develop

With this command, you can continue to work in your feature branch and update the `develop` or `master` branch. No need to stash your current changes because you need to switch branches anymore!

It‚Äôs super easy and valuable to me. I thought It might be helpful to you as well üëç

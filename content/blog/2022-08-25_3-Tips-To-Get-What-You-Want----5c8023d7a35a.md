#### YOUR WORDS HAVE MUCH MORE POWER THAN YOU THINK

![](/Users/devbyrayray/Downloads/medium-export-a7b31d8cfbafc479a349e86525a0598d57555fb548cdfad5aa20f48d7b4db09d/posts/md_1664876347726/img/0__28yrsQn2QwvELwZz.jpg)

Be careful of what you say, because you can attract everything you say! Both positive & negative! We, people, are complaining A LOT! (_Hopefully, you're not doing that_ 😉)

*   _I hate driving in traffic._
*   _Complain about colleagues at work_
*   _Hating your job_
*   _Annoying kids_
*   _I want everything to be like the old days_
*   _I long for the moment everything was better_
*   _Etc_

I know everyone recognizes a few or all of the things on the list. But hé, we want to attract nice, beautiful, and good things in our lives. Let’s dive into how we can attract more of that! I’m sure we can make it miles long.

### 1\. Power Of Your Words

In words, we say and think there is so much power! Don’t you agree? No? Okay, let’s check if you recognize some of these situations in your life.

#### **Bullied kid**

I don’t know your age, but let’s get back to your school time. Do you remember that bullied kid in the classroom? Maybe you were that kid yourself. 💔

The one that always looked scared in their eyes? The one we ran out of school so the kids that bullied couldn’t find them.

Those kids’ behavior came from all the things those bullies said and their actions. All caused by words 🤯. Those words had severe effects.

#### **The Power Of Compliments**

Hopefully, you have given a lot of compliments in your life because those words are equally powerful!

Most of the time, complimenting your wife, husband, kid, friend, or other loved one will result in smiles (most of the time).

Giving compliments to strangers can be heartwarming as well ♥️. Some will instantly smile and thank you! You can make someone smile by doing so 😉

#### **How do you talk to yourself?**

Do you say positive or negative things about yourself? You can make or break yourself!

When we say positive things about ourselves, we change our minds and can attract positive things. If you say words like, I can’t do this or that, your right because that’s what you will attract over your life!

I guess everyone wants to have nice things in life. The nice things in life can be different for everyone.

### 2\. Law Of Attraction

Now that we know our voice and mind are powerful tools, we must become aware of the law of attraction. Everyone can apply the law of attraction to every topic in life.

In my childhood, we went to church on Sunday, and one of the things I learned in church is: “**Faith comes by hearing**” ([Sentence from the Bible Romans 10:17](https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm)) It doesn’t matter if you are Christian; believe in a higher power or don’t believe in anything else.

But what is clear is that the words we hear with our physical ears and hear in our minds do something with us. It can change behavior, circumstances you encounter, challenges in your life, or blessings you receive.

### 3\. Manifesting

Since words can change so many things, we must be careful with what we say, think, and wish.

If you say words like:

*   _I’m so grateful for all things in life_
*   _I love myself_
*   _I’m a great father or mother_
*   _I’m a loving wife to my husband_
*   _I have more than enough money_
*   _I am patient_

Even though they are not a reality, if you say it like it already happened, you will re-program your brain and start believing it. And it will become a reality!

Say it as much as you can, and your belief in it will be strong. And from that moment, you are manifesting great things over your life and the lives of your loved ones!

Because if we set our state of mind into the perspective we want to live in, we will attract all these things. You will spread that energy from your heart and behavior, and others will start seeing it too.

I think blogs for animals (no matter the type of animal) will attract people to read it. But I don’t have pets, I do love cats 🐱 btw. But I wouldn’t be a loyal follower because you have a animal blog.  
  
If I had a cat, dog, or other animals, I would Google for tips on how to feed and entertain them. So a blog like the one you want to start would be the type of blog I want to read then 😉

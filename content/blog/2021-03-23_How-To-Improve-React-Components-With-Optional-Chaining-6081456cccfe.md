If youâ€™re working on a big React (Next.js) application, sometimes you might need to dive deep into a data structure. Itâ€™s pretty generic. The React component Iâ€™m talking about would look like this:

If any property of `content` or `blok` is missing, we have a big problem. The page will break and the user will get an error. ðŸ¥º

### Improvement: Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing Operator

We need two JavaScript features to prevent a massive error: [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) and the [nullish coalescing operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator). Donâ€™t worry, this all sounds more complicated than it actually is.

#### Optional chaining

Optional chaining looks like this: `content?.content?.blok`. The browser will first check if there is a `content` property inside the `content` object instead of assuming that this property exists. If it doesn't exist, it won't show an error but will make the variable `nullish`. So it doesn't have a value.

#### Nullish coalescing operator

Now that our variable can be nullish, this means it can be `null` or `undefined`. But we want to show both titles on the page instead of nothing.

The nullish coalescing operator looks like this:Â `??`. It checks if the operator's left value is `null` or `undefined`. If it is, you can give it a fallback value.

So it looks like this: `content?.content?.blokÂ ?? 'Title'`. If the value is nullish, it will assign the `'Title'` to the variable. If the value isn't nullish, it will assign the title from the deeply nested object.

### Improved React Component

If we implement the solutions we discussed before, our component looks like this:

Now, the user will always have a title and no errors. Itâ€™s better to be prepared for mistakes so that the user can continue their journey through the application.

Yes, the user will see a faulty title, but thatâ€™s far better than showing an actual error or, even worse, the page not showing!

### Conclusion

Hopefully, this will help you improve your React components. Be prepared if the content doesnâ€™t load or exist! And make sure the user has a great user experience.

_Happy coding_ ðŸš€!

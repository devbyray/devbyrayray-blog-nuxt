In this article, I want to show you how simple it is to get rid of duplicated data. There are a few places duplicated data can appear for whatever reason.

There‚Äôs nothing more annoying than duplicated data in your JavaScript. So let‚Äôs get into a practical walk-through of how you can work against it.

I highly suggest not simply copying and pasting my code. Of course, you can‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut please follow my explanation to understand how it works.

## 1\. Array With Duplicated Strings or¬†Numbers

const dupStrings = \['Angular', 'React', 'VueJS', 'Svelte', 'React'\]  
const dupNumbers = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,2,4,6,7,8,9,0\]

The first array has some duplicated strings, and the other array has duplicated numbers in it.

To get rid of the duplicated data, we‚Äôre going to use `Set`. `Set` only accepts unique values.

> "`Set` objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. A value in the `Set` **may only occur once**; it is unique in the `Set`'s collection.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)

console.log(new Set(dupStrings))

// Set(5) {"Angular", "React", "VueJS", "Svelte", ""}

console.log(new Set(dupNumbers))

// Set(10) {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0}

When we put the arrays in a `Set` and output it to the console, you‚Äôll see the duplicated values are removed from the array.

In the CodeSandbox below, you can see how it works.

Check out the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/array-with-duplicated-strings-ornumbers-fu3d2)

But now, we turned it into a `Set`, and we need the cleaned array back so we can do our JavaScript magic further.

The easiest way to do this is by using the¬†`...` [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) inside the array brackets `[...]`. Let‚Äôs put that into a function so we can reuse it everywhere in our application.

### Create a¬†function

Now we need to create a function from it so we can reuse it on other places.

### How does the function¬†work?

In our function, we define a parameter, `array`, which we expect to be an array. We check this in the `if` statement.

*   `!array`: We simply check if the array is `null` or `undefined`
*   `!Array.isArray(array)`: We use the array helper method to check if the value of `array` is, indeed, an array. If you put the¬†`!` before it, we check if the output is `false`¬†.
*   `array.length === 0`: We use this to check if the array has a length of `0‚Ää`‚Äî‚Ääthis indicates an empty array

If one of the conditions are met, we let the function return the array that has been given in the function.

If the conditions aren‚Äôt met, it‚Äôll put the array in the `new Set()`, and we turn it into an array by using the¬†`...` spread syntax.

Finally, we need to call the function.

unDuplicateArraySingleValues(array)

### Test the¬†function

Check in the example below if everything works correctly.

Check the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/array-with-duplicated-strings-ornumbers-with-function-jwrj9)

## 2\. Array With Duplicated Objects

Let‚Äôs define an example array of objects with duplicate information

const dupObjects = \[  
   { id: 1, name: "a", value: "c" },  
   { id: 2, name: "b", value: "d" },  
   { id: 2, name: "c", value: "e" },  
   { id: 3, name: "d", value: "c" }  
\];

You can see there are a few property values that are duplicated.

I think it sounds obvious that you don‚Äôt want any duplicated information in your array of objects.

### Create a¬†function

So we need a function that checks our array and, based on a given property, checks if there‚Äôs an other object that has a property with the same information.

This `function` starts the same as in the previous example. So it‚Äôd be a good idea to make a new `function` for that. In this example, we keep it the same.

### How does the function¬†work?

In our `function`, we define a parameter, `array,` which we expect to be an array. We check this in the `if` statement.

*   `!array`: We simply check if the array is `null` or `undefined`
*   `!Array.isArray(array)`: We use the array helper method to check if the value of `array` is, indeed, an array. If you put the¬†`!` before it, we check if the output is `false`.
*   `array.length === 0`: We use this to check if the array has a length of `0‚Ää`‚Äî‚Ääthis indicates an empty array.
*   `!property`: With this, we check if the property value is `false`‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich means we check for `null`, `undefined`, or `0`¬†. Because if any of these are the case, we can‚Äôt check for duplicate information in our objects.

Then we create a variable, `objectArrayKeys,` in which we store an array of the values of the properties we‚Äôve given in the `propertyName` parameter.

In `uniqueKeys`, we remove duplicate values. But we make use of our previous function. This function returns a new array with only unique values.

At last, we return an array with only unique objects based on the `uniqueKeys` array.

Finally, we need to call the function.

unDuplicateArrayObjects(dupObjects, "id")

### Test the¬†function

In the example below, check changing the property names in the function so we can verify everything works correctly.

## Conclusion

I hope you learned how to get rid of duplicated data in your array with single values or an array with objects.

I personally have googled this question thousands of times. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve written this tutorial for you.

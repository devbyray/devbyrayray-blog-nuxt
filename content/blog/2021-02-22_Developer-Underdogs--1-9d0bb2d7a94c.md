#### Every issue is packed with links to projects, tutorials, and blogposts by the Underdog Developers.

I‚Äôve tried it a couple of times before, but never did I do it like this. Creating a weekly newsletter for developers is not difficult. Creating a newsletter that developers actually want to read is a completely different story.

So this time, it‚Äôs not me who‚Äôs going to write a long story in an email. No, because developers like us don‚Äôt like to be in their email clients checking emails.

We want to discover great resources on the web. Find the newest and hottest tips for being a better developer. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do!

Every week the best links, projects, tutorials I found myself in your mailbox so you can become a better developer. And no, it‚Äôs not gonna be filled with the most popular links you find somewhere else.

This is gonna be filled with small, high-quality, dev-written posts. Created by beginners, Codenewbies, junior devs, and the underdogs who never got a stage!

Did you found a great underdog link? Please share it via Twitter with me [@devbyrayray](https://twitter.com/devbyrayray?utm_campaign=Developer%20Underdogs&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

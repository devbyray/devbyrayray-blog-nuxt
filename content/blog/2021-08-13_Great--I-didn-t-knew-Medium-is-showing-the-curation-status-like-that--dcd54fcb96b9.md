Great, I didn't knew Medium is showing the curation status like that!

I created a script which let you get the information easier via the browser console.

[https://gist.github.com/devbyray/84e6fd4b402ebcd703d161f01f16986a](https://gist.github.com/devbyray/84e6fd4b402ebcd703d161f01f16986a)

Just copy the code. Open the developer tools of the browser. Open the "console" tab and paste the code.

When the status is found, the there will be an alert with the information.

I hope this can help someone ❤️
